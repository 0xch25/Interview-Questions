# Arrays
1. Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this inplace? (Matrix rotation problem)
2. Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and column are set to 0.
