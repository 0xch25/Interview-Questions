# Strings
1. Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use addtional data structures?
2. How to reverse a string in c?
3. Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other?
4. Write a method to replace all spaces in a stirng with '%20'.
  * You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end of the string to hold the additional characters,
  * and that you are given the "true" length of the string. (Note: if implementing in java, please use a character array so that you can perform this operation in place.)
5.  Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string `aabcccccaaa` would become `a2b1c5a3`.
  * If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string.
6. Assume you have a method `isSubstring` which checks if one word is a substring of another. Given two strings, s1 and s2, write code to check if s2 is a rotation of s1 using only one call to isSubstring (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of "erbottlewat").
7. Given an array of integers and an integer k, find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] = nums[j] and the difference between i and j is at most k.
8. Given a sorted array arr[] and a number x, write a function that counts the occurrences of x in arr[].
9. Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
  * For example,
    * the longest substrings without repeating characters for “ABDEFGABEF” are “BDEFGA” and “DEFGAB”, with length 6.
    * For “BBBB” the longest substring is “B”, with length 1.
    * For “GEEKSFORGEEKS”, there are two longest substrings shown in the below diagrams, with length 7.
10. Find the sum of contiguous subarray within a one-dimensional array of numbers which has the largest sum.
11. Find the most popular element in int[] array
12. Find all N! permutation of the elements of an array
13. Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.
  * Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this in place with constant memory.
