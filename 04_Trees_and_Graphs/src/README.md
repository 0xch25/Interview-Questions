# Trees and Graphs

## Trees
- ✔ Given a binary tree and a sum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum. **hasPathSum**
- Write a program to verify whether the given tree is a binary search tree.( with and without using recursion)
- Check if all the leaves are at the same level in a binary tree
- Given a tree, find the path that sums up to a given number **pathSum**
- Using a tree, find the first common ancestor of two nodes
- Print out the parent and children given a particular depth in a given tree.
- Determine if the tree is balanced
- How to check whether a binary tree is identical to another binary tree? What is the time complexity?
- Serialization and deserialization of a tree to a string. If every node of tree represents a letter serialize tree to string in a way that you can deserialize the same string to a tree again. 
- Nearest ancestor node of binary tree.
- Given the inorder traversal of a n-ary tree where every node can have either n or 0 children, and is marked "p" if that node has n children, or marked "q" if that node has 0 children, try reconstruct that tree.
- Convert each level of Binary tree into a linked list
- Given a binary tree(not necessarily BST), return the sum of all kth level nodes. What is the complexity?
- Level order traversal of a binary tree

## Graphs
- ✔ You are given a list of projects and a list of dependencies. All of a project's dependencies must be built before the project is. Find a build order that will allow the projects to be built. If there is no valid build order return an error. **projectDependencies**
