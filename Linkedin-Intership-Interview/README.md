Round 1:
========

1. Given a array of string followed by two words. Find the minimum distance between the two words in the given array of string.
  ```python
  
  For example:(“the”, “quick”, “brown”, “fox”, “quick”)
     * distance(“fox”,”the”) == 3
     * distance(“quick”, “fox”) == 1
  
  ```
2. Given two sorted array of Strings, Implement a merged sorted array of string
  ```python
  
  A[ ] = {"good", "person" }
  B[ ] = { "he", "is" }
  return { "good", "he", "is", "person"}
  
  ```
**Update: Use [a bithacked merge routine instead](https://github.com/AlgorithmCrackers/Interview-Questions/tree/master/Bit-Hacks/Merge-Two-Sorted-Arrays)**

Round 2:
========
1. You are supposed to do a level order traversal of a binary tree(not necessarily complete) and have to print a special character(say ‘$’) after completion of each level.

**Update: [Check this](https://gist.github.com/bcjordan/7537486)**

2. Given a number print all the combination in which no. can be printed.
for eg.

```
Input:
3
Output:
2 1
1 2
1 1 2
```
