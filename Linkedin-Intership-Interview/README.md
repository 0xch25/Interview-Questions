Round 1:
========

1.  Given a array of string followed by two words. Find the minimum distance between the two words in the given array of string.

>  For example:(“the”, “quick”, “brown”, “fox”, “quick”)
>     * distance(“fox”,”the”) == 3
>     * distance(“quick”, “fox”) == 1

2.  Given two sorted array of Strings, Implement a merged sorted array of string

>     A[ ] = {"good", "person" }
>     B[ ] = { "he", "is" }
>     return { "good", "he", "is", "person"}

Round 2:
========
1. You are supposed to do a level order traversal of a binary tree(not necessarily complete) and have to print a special character(say ‘$’) after completion of each level.
2.  Given a number print all the combination in which no. can be printed.
for eg.

> Input: 3
> Output: 2 1
     1 2 
     1 1
      1
